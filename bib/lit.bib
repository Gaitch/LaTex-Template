abstract = {The traditional power spectral subtraction algorithm is computationally simple to implement but suffers from musical noise distortion. In addition, the subtractive rules are based on incorrect assumptions about the cross terms being zero. A new geometric approach to spectral subtraction is proposed in the present paper that addresses these shortcomings of the spectral subtraction algorithm. A method for estimating the cross terms involving the phase differences between the noisy (and clean) signals and noise is proposed. Analysis of the gain function of the proposed algorithm indicated that it possesses similar properties as the traditional MMSE algorithm. Objective evaluation of the proposed algorithm showed that it performed significantly better than the traditional spectral subtractive algorithm. Informal listening tests revealed that the proposed algorithm had no audible musical noise.}

abstract = {This paper discusses the problem of single channel speech enhancement in stationary environments, and proposes Wiener filtering with the recursive noise estimation algorithm. The Wiener filter is a linear estimator and minimizes the mean-squared error between the original and enhanced speech. The algorithm is implemented in the frequency domain and depends on the filter transfer function from sample to sample based on the speech signal statistics; the local mean and the local variance. For the noise estimation, the recursive noise estimation approach is used. In this approach, the noise estimation is done by past and present spectral power values, using a smoothing parameter. The value of smoothing parameter is selected in between [0 1]. For the performance evaluation of the proposed speech enhancement algorithm objective evaluations with informal listening tests are conducted for the speech sentences, pronounced by male and female speakers from the NOIZEUS corpus, degraded by White as well as Pink noise types at different SNR levels. For objective measures, signal to noise ratio, segmental signal to noise ratio, and the perceptual evaluation of speech quality are used. The measures prove that the speech enhanced by proposed algorithm is more pleasant to the human ear for both noise conditions in comparison to the conventional speech enhancement method.}
